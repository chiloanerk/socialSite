# My PHP CRUD App

This is a PHP CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that serves as a base for building my future projects. 
It provides a framework for managing data through a web interface.

## Usage

To use the CRUD app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to the project directory:

`cd project_directory`


3. Start the PHP development server by running the following command:

`php -S localhost:port -t public`


Replace `port` with the desired port number (e.g., 8000).

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:port`.

5. You will be presented with the homepage (`index.php`), which displays the available functionality.

6. Use the navigation links or input forms to perform CRUD operations on the data entities, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
